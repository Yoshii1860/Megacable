Thank you for purchasing the Rhythm Timeline VR demo

This demo scene uses Open XR and should work on all VR headsets in theory.
But this demo was built and tested on a Meta Quest 3.
Due to limited resources other devices are not officially supported.

Make sure to install the Open XR package to get started
com.unity.xr.meta-openxr@2.0
com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit

and their dependencies


The Mesh cutting is partly handled by an open source package called ez-slice:
